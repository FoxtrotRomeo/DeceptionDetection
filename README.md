# Deception Detection in Dyadic Exchanges Using Multimodal Machine Learning

This repository contains the code accompanying the paper:

**"Deception Detection in Dyadic Exchanges Using Multimodal Machine Learning: A Study on a Swedish Cohort"**  
Preprint available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21429).

The goal of this repository is to increase the reproducibility of our experiments and provide a reference implementation for future research on multimodal deception detection, particularly in dyadic contexts.

## 🧠 Overview

The paper explores multimodal machine learning techniques to detect deception in dyadic interactions, using a unique Swedish-language dataset. It compares early vs. late fusion strategies and examines the impact of incorporating features from both participants in a conversation.

The codebase includes:
- Feature extraction and preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Comparison of fusion strategies
- Scripts for reproducibility and persistent use
